# PA165-SportClub

School project for PA165 subject at Masaryk University - Faculty of Informatics for managing sport teams and their rosters.



## <a name="description"></a>Description

Think of a sports club for a team sport (football, ice hockey etc.). Create a system managing teams and players. Each team is defined by its name and an age group (men, juniors etc.) given by an interval between two years of birth. Each player is described by his first name, last name, height, weight and date of birth. Each team has a roster of players listing their jersey numbers on the team. It is important that each player's age group matches the age group of the team, but a player is allowed to be on the roster of a team one level above (i.e. a younger player can be on the team of a higher age group). That implies a player can be listed on multiple team rosters.
